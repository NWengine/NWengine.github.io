# Precompiled engine

For installing the engine, check [release page](hhttps://github.com/Wildric-Auric/NWengine/releases), in the latest release (if published) you would find the build for *Windows 32-bit* and *Windows 64-bit*.
We are looking forward having a future for *Mac* and *Linux* based systems.
<br></br>
If you are want to build the engine from source code either using Visual Studio or only using MSVC compiler you may want to follow the follwing guide.
<br></br>
In all cases you will need to have Visual Studio installed, as it is not possible to get MSVC without installing visual studio.

# Compile with Visual Studio UI

# Compile using NWengine build system.
