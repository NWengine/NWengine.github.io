NWengine is a 2D game engine designed to be flexible. It is built 
with a modular design, which means that it can be easily customized 
and extended to fit the needs of individual developers and projects. All the design of this game engine is guided by the spirit of flexibility, as the goal is to make it in midway between a classical game engine and a framework. Hence the choice of not implementing visual scripting nor for gameplay nor for shaders. By design, the user is encouraged to make a wide kind of implementation through scripting.
